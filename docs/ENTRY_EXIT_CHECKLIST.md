## üìå APPENDIX: EXAMPLE TRADES

### Example 1: Perfect Long Setup (6/6 conditions)

**Setup:**

- Symbol: BTC/USDT
- TF: 1H
- Date: 2025-10-01

**Pre-Trade Analysis:**

```
‚úÖ 1. Price at VAL ($62,500) - discount entry
‚úÖ 2. 4H POC at $65,000 (above) - not buying premium
‚úÖ 3. EMA Cloud bullish (price $62,500 > cloud $61,000)
‚úÖ 4. CVD rising (CVD 1.2M > MA 800K)
‚úÖ 5. VSA: SP (Spring) at VAL - panic selling
‚úÖ 6. Multi-TF: 15m green, 1H green, 4H green
```

**Entry:**

- Entry: $62,500
- Stop: $61,000 (below VAL)
- Risk: $1,500 per BTC

**Targets:**

- T1 (POC): $63,500 (R:R 1:0.66)
- T2 (VAH): $64,500 (R:R 1:1.33)
- T3 (4H POC): $65,000 (R:R 1:1.66)

**Result:**

- Exit: $65,000 (T3 reached)
- P&L: +$2,500 per BTC
- R-multiple: +1.66R
- Duration: 8 hours

**Lessons:** Perfect setup, all conditions met, high probability trade ‚úÖ

### Example 2: Failed Long Setup (3/6 conditions)

**Setup:**

- Symbol: ETH/USDT
- TF: 1H
- Date: 2025-10-02

**Pre-Trade Analysis:**

```
‚úÖ 1. Price at VAL ($2,400) - discount entry
‚ùå 2. 4H POC at $2,350 (below) - buying premium ‚ùå
‚ö†Ô∏è 3. EMA Cloud neutral (price inside cloud)
‚ùå 4. CVD falling (CVD 500K < MA 700K)
‚úÖ 5. VSA: NS (No Supply) at VAL
‚ö†Ô∏è 6. Multi-TF: 15m green, 1H green, 4H red (mixed)
```

**Decision:** SKIP (only 2 ‚úÖ, HTF unfavorable, CVD bearish)

**What Would Have Happened:**

- Price bounced to $2,420 (+0.8%)
- Then dropped to $2,300 (-4.2%)
- Stop would have been hit

**Lessons:** HTF structure and CVD alignment critical, avoiding bad setup saved capital ‚úÖ
